\item With large n and small p, a less flexible method may not use the large 
  amount of observations available. A flexible method would be able to better 
  estimate the true f, just like Figure 2.3 -- 2.6. Caution must be taken not 
  to over-fit the data.
\item With small n and large p, a less flexible method may protect us from 
fluctuations in the observation due to small n. 
\item A nonlinear relationship between p and the response, may require a more 
  flexible method as in shown in Figure 2.11.
\item The choice of method may be independent of the variance in the error.
